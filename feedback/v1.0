some improvements to be made: 
1) login page to have a central box, and the elements to be placed in the middle of window
2) title still doesn't say "Welcome to Sevabot, Swapnil!", just Sevabot
3) the feedback doesnt get stored in the answers when switched to other chats and come back again to the original chat.
4) uploading has some error with respect to some files like 1/2 mb. identify what's the exact issue.
5) the window is not scrollable or within 100% window size. optimise the space to make it look like chatgpt, seamless box
6) the chat/file manager and space between that and welcome title is too much. also chat/FM size is small, they should be atleast normal, mabye in button light format.
7) see if #sessions can be incrementally added without warning, and IF there's a warning. 
8) batch testing api endpoint with excel file upload option with questions and dummy answers. write an evaluation script to compare the answers.
9) increase the conversational history loading speed for a session. Also why the sessions bar loads whenever an inferencing is happening?
