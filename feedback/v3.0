admin chat:
1) ✅ when user chats are selected, when i click on new chat, it redirects to the logged in user chat and not the user chat. 
2) ✅ when a message is dropped in a user chat, it puts the message but again shows my chat
3) ✅  when feedback is not given, new chat/sesions/text box input are disabled

files:
1) ✅ it shows files refreshed with files, but doesn't populate the table - both for admins and handle_user_file_search
2) ✅ should show common + personal files, if any.

file manager (common):
✅ perfect!

file manager (users):
✅ chunks status shows 0 for a selected users, and status as available instead of indexed.

rag:
1) for rag, when selected for a user, it should refer to the common knowledge and respective user's rag db for answering.

users:
1) when a user is added, spoc assignment should be mandatory
2) promote or demote user should be renamed to add spoc, remove spoc
3) when spocs are removed, users should be in an orphaned bucket.
4) when there are no spocs, when a new user gets onboard other than admin, he will be spoc by default.
5) reduce whitelisted emails to top k entries scrollable table
6) make deletion table separate. 
7) when spoc assignment is removed, it should be mandatory to assign it to a different spoc
8) there shouldn't be spoc assignment feature as users are mandatorily assigned to spoc anyways.

code optimisation: 
1) move styling code to styles.py
2) user management.py is lying redundant as it's code is written in ui.py towards the end
