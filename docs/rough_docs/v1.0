while onboarding, 2 options : add as a SPOC, assign to a SPOC

data backup for delete - introduce active/inactive flag for chat sessions - may  not be required later

for spocs clarification to the user:
- manually go through chats and reply if necessary, augmented answer with q/a reference
- send notif to user for augmented answer
- append the clarification in the same answer, send notif to notif tab. when user clicks on it, ideally it redirects to the same augmented answer.
